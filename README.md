# Boris Bikes - Week 1 Challenge
-------------

A program that emulates all the docking stations, bikes, and infrastructure (repair staff, and so on) required to make their dream a reality.

## Description
--------------

The week 1 Makers Academy challenge was an introduction into OOD and TDD. This was my first experience using RSpec and I learned a lot from this challenge. Not only did I learn the practical application of TDD and why it is useful, but I also learned integral RSpec tools such as doubles and stubbing.

## Skills Learned
-----------------
- Object Oriented Programming
- Coding using test-driven development
- RSpec as a testing framework
- Doubles and stubbing random behaviour in RSpec
- Class interaction in Ruby
